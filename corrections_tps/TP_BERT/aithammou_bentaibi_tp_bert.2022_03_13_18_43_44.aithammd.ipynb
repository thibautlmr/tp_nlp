    "<em>The key arguments for the low utilization of statistical techniques in financial sentiment analysis have been the difficulty of implementation for practical applications and the lack of high quality training data for building such models. Especially in the case of finance and economic texts, annotated collections are a scarce resource and many are reserved for proprietary use only. To resolve the missing training data problem, we present a collection of ∼ 5000 sentences to establish human-annotated standards for benchmarking alternative modeling techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "<em>The objective of the phrase level annotation task was to classify each example sentence into a positive, negative or neutral category by considering only the information explicitly available in the given sentence. Since the study is focused only on financial and economic domains, the annotators were asked to consider the sentences from the view point of an investor only; i.e. whether the news may have positive, negative or neutral influence on the stock price. As a result, sentences which have a sentiment that is not relevant from an economic or financial perspective are considered neutral.\n",

The selected collection of phrases was annotated by 16 people with adequate background knowledge on financial markets. Three of the annotators were researchers and the remaining 13 annotators were master’s students at Aalto University School of Business with majors primarily in finance, accounting, and economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>Given the large number of overlapping annotations (5 to 8 annotations per sentence), there are several ways to define a majority vote based gold standard. To provide an objective comparison, we have formed 4 alternative reference datasets based on the strength of majority agreement: \n",

    "<em>As Transfer Learning from large-scale pre-trained models becomes more prevalent in Natural Language Processing (NLP), operating these large models in on-the-edge and/or under constrained computational training or inference budgets remains challenging. In this work, we propose a method to pre-train a smaller general-purpose language representation model, called DistilBERT, which can then be fine-tuned with good performances on a wide range of tasks like its larger counterparts. While most prior work investigated the use of distillation for building task-specific models, we leverage knowledge distillation during the pre-training phase and show that it is possible to reduce the size of a BERT model by 40%, while retaining 97% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60% faster. To leverage the inductive biases learned by larger models during pre-training, we introduce a triple loss combining language modeling, distillation and cosine-distance losses. Our smaller, faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its capabilities for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a comparative on-device study."

    "1.   le tokenize_out est un dictionnaire qui contient deux listes , une d'input ids des tokens et une autre \"attention mask\" qui est une liste des valeurs binaires (0 ou 1) qui fait la difference entre tokens masques(que le modele essaie de predire) et ceux non masques \n",
    "2.   Le tokeniseur ajoute un élément [CLS] au début de la phrase et un élément [SEP] à la fin. Le premier indique le début de la phrase et le deuxième est utilisé pour séparer les deux phrases d'une tache.\n",
    "3. Le tokeniseur fait ça par soucis de compression. Quand il voit qu'il y'a un sous-mot qu'il a déjà vu comme token, il subdivise le mot et ajoute le double hashtag pour annoncer que c'est un sous-mot qu'il faut coller au token précèdent.\n",
    "4. Il a besoin d'un entrainement préalable comme chaque intelligence artificiel pour avoir une base de mot sur laquel il doit s'appuyer pour commencer à apprendre de nouvelles choses dans la vrai vie. <span style=\"color:red\">The tokenizer is not a NN or ML algorithm. Nonetheless, the compression algorithm (byte pair encoding) need to learn the most efficient compression on training data before applying it to other data. Here, we are applying a tokenization that was learned on the training set of the pre-trained BERT. </span> \n"
